# Continue Functionality After ESC Interruption

## Overview

This document explains the implementation of the "continue" functionality that allows users to resume interrupted AI responses in the Qwen CLI.

## The Problem

When users press ESC to interrupt an AI response (especially long explanations or lists), they expect to be able to type "continue" and have the AI resume from where it left off. This is a standard pattern in AI chat interfaces like ChatGPT or Claude.

Previously, the system would:
1. Properly cancel the response when ESC was pressed
2. Show a message saying "You can say 'continue' to resume"
3. But when the user typed "continue", it was just treated as a new query with no context

## The Solution

The fix implements proper context preservation and continuation handling:

### 1. Context Storage

When ESC interrupts a response, we now store:
- The original user prompt that triggered the response
- The partial response that was generated before interruption
- A timestamp to ensure the context doesn't get stale

```typescript
const interruptedContextRef = useRef<{
  originalPrompt?: string;
  partialResponse?: string;
  timestamp?: number;
}>({});
```

### 2. Continue Command Detection

The system now recognizes various forms of continuation commands:
- "continue"
- "go on"
- "keep going"
- "resume"
- "proceed"

### 3. Context Reconstruction

When a continue command is detected, the system:
1. Checks if there's valid interrupted context (within 5 minutes)
2. Creates a special prompt that includes:
   - The original user question
   - The partial response that was generated
   - Instructions to continue from where it left off
3. Sends this contextualized prompt to the AI

## Usage Example

```
User: Explain quantum computing in detail
AI: Quantum computing is a revolutionary approach to computation that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike classical computers that use bits representing either 0 or 1, quantum computers use quantum bits or "qubits" that can exist in superposition states...
[User presses ESC]
System: â†‘ Response was interrupted. You can say "continue" to resume or provide new instructions.
User: continue
AI: ...allowing them to represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This fundamental difference enables quantum computers to perform certain calculations exponentially faster than classical computers. The key quantum phenomena utilized are superposition and entanglement...
```

## Technical Implementation

The implementation involves three main changes to `useQwenStream.ts`:

1. **ESC Handler Update**: Captures the interrupted context when ESC is pressed
2. **Query Preparation**: Detects continue commands and constructs contextualized prompts
3. **State Management**: Ensures the interrupted context is cleared after use

## Testing

Two test scripts are provided:

1. `test-esc-cancel-fix.js` - Tests basic ESC cancellation functionality
2. `test-continue-functionality.js` - Tests the continue feature specifically

Run the tests with:
```bash
node test-continue-functionality.js
```

## Limitations

- The interrupted context expires after 5 minutes to prevent confusion
- Only text responses can be continued (not tool executions)
- The AI needs to understand the continuation context, which works well with capable models

## Future Improvements

- Store multiple interruption contexts for complex conversations
- Add visual indicators showing continuable content
- Support continuation of tool execution sequences
- Persist interruption context across CLI restarts
