# ESC Cancellation Fix - Major Update

## ðŸŽ‰ Fixed: ESC Cancellation and Continue Functionality

We've resolved the critical issue where pressing ESC during operations would leave the system in an inconsistent state, preventing users from continuing their work.

### What Was Fixed

#### Root Cause
The system wasn't properly recording partial AI responses in the conversation history when operations were cancelled with ESC. This broke the natural "continue" functionality that relies on the AI seeing its own incomplete responses.

#### The Solution
- **Restored proper tool response flow**: Cancelled tool responses are now sent back to the AI (as designed in the original Gemini architecture)
- **Removed interfering custom logic**: Removed the custom "continue" functionality that was breaking the natural conversation flow
- **Fixed conversation history**: Partial AI responses are now properly recorded in conversation history even when interrupted

### How It Works Now

1. **Press ESC**: Cancels the current operation cleanly
2. **Type "continue"**: The AI naturally continues from where it left off
3. **Normal operation**: The system immediately accepts new commands

### Technical Details

The fix aligns with the original Gemini CLI architecture:
- Every tool request must complete its request-response cycle
- Partial responses are preserved in the AI's conversation history
- The AI's natural language understanding handles continuation context
- No special state management or markers needed

### Breaking Changes
None - this fix restores the intended behavior.

### Migration
No action needed. The fix is backward compatible and improves the user experience immediately.

### For Developers
The key insight: trust the original architecture. The system was designed to handle interruptions gracefully through proper conversation history management, not through custom state tracking.
