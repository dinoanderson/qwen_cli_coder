# ESC Cancellation Fix Test Plan

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Cancel Shell Command and Resume
1. Ask the AI to run a long-running command (e.g., "run sleep 10")
2. Press ESC while the command is executing
3. Verify the AI receives the cancellation response
4. Type a new command - it should work immediately

### 2. Cancel Tool Confirmation
1. Ask the AI to perform an action that requires confirmation
2. When the confirmation dialog appears, press ESC
3. Verify the system returns to idle state
4. Type a new command - it should work

### 3. Cancel AI Response and Continue
1. Ask a question that generates a long response
2. Press ESC while the AI is responding
3. Type "continue" 
4. Verify the AI continues from where it left off

## Expected Behavior

- After ESC, the system should always return to idle state
- The AI should acknowledge cancelled operations
- New commands should work immediately without errors
- The conversation flow should remain intact

## Root Cause Fixed

The issue was that cancelled tool responses were not being sent back to the AI, breaking the conversation flow. The AI was waiting for tool responses that never arrived, causing the system to get stuck.

By ensuring cancelled tool responses are sent back to the AI (just like successful ones), we maintain the proper conversation flow as designed in the original Gemini architecture.
